                        Yep, you gotta love that almost 90% market share failure. Like I said before, if that's failure than sign me up for some of that. I'm pretty sure the good people over at Apple, Google, etc. would like to be signed up for some of that failure too.<br/><br/>
For the, "If this, if that, (insert scenario)" people, enjoy your new OS and whatever other new software you may choose to use. However, don't be surprised when those metro ui interface imitations start to land on those products too. Did you really think that static grid-icons on a screen was going to last forever? I think 20+ years is enough, it's time for new innovation in design and don't be surprised when the copycats jump on board. That's the way the industry works. One group comes up with a new design or concept and the others tend to follow suit and you don't have to be a market leader to get that following. Just ask the Opera/Chrome developers. That's just one of many, many examples that could be pointed out. The metro ui is a very suitable design for the touch screen world that we're migrating to. Sure, there will be changes and enhancements as time goes on and everyone will put their own spin on it, but I'd get used to similar offerings from MSFT's competitors if I were you.<br/><br/>
Also, for those who like to comment, but seem to have little info about what's expected in things like Windows 8, let me fill you in a bit. The info. out right now is that Windows 8 will let you choose to use the new ui or to use the more, "Windows past" icon ui. I think anyone with some modicum of common sense can see how that would be a wise move from MSFT. For instance: The metro ui may not appeal to the corporate world as much as the consumer world. Plus, it give long-time Window's users the option to stick with what they know, but still gain the newest features and security measures that new OS's tend to bring. So, if your going to use another product, but all means, have fun with it, but don't try to justify it to yourself with reasons that are unlikely to exist. Just say you want to move on and anyone else can respect that, but when you seem to have little knowledge of what your options will be, it just makes you look like the typical sheep some people can be.<br/><br/>
Personally, I love the new direction MSFT is going in and for the first time in years, they seem to be thinking more and more consumer friendly. That's not an easy task for a company who has to appeal to business the way MSFT does and I commend the effort. Believe me, or don't, but Apple, Google and any other group would suffer the same balancing act if they dominated the corporate world the way Microsoft does. Corporate and consumers are very different beasts and it's not always easy to appeal to both, yet Microsoft has kept a large following in both sectors and anyone who doesn't see the skill it takes to do that, has a lot to learn my friends.                    </p>
