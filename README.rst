python-readability
==================

Given a html document, it pulls out the main body text and cleans it up.

This is a python port of a ruby port of `arc90's readability
project <http://lab.arc90.com/experiments/readability/>`__.

Installation
------------

It's easy using ``pip``, just run:

::

    $ pip install readability-lxml

Usage
-----

::

    >> import requests
    >> from readability import Document
    >>
    >> response = requests.get('http://example.com')
    >> doc = Document(response.text)
    >> doc.title()
    >> 'Example Domain'
    >> doc.summary()
    >> u'<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody">\n<div>\n    <h1>Example Domain</h1>\n
    <p>This domain is established to be used for illustrative examples in documents. You may
    use this\n    domain in examples without prior coordination or asking for permission.</p>
    \n    <p><a href="http://www.iana.org/domains/example">More information...</a></p>\n</div>
    \n</body>\n</div></body></html>'
