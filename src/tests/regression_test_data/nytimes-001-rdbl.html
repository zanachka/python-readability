In the first three seasons of the AMC series &#8220;Breaking Bad,&#8221; Aaron Paul &#8212; or rather, his meth-dealing character, Jesse Pinkman &#8212; has been slapped, mauled and beaten purple by, respectively, a hit man, a sociopath and a federal drug-enforcement agent. If he were a pi&#241;ata, the candy would have poured out of this guy long ago. And apparently there is little mercy for Paul in the new season on the way. For there Paul was, one day in late May, standing on Tijeras Avenue in downtown Albuquerque, being tasered by a brawny man in sunglasses.        </p>

The street had been blocked off, and a crew of dozens waited as the actors rehearsed the assault with Vince Gilligan, the creator, head writer and show runner, who was also directing the episode.        </p><p>
&#8220;Maybe we play this moment just a little longer, so we know for sure he got zapped,&#8221; Gilligan said. &#8220;Otherwise, Jesse would fight back more.&#8221;        </p><p>
&#8220;Yeah, I like that,&#8221; Paul said.        </p><p>
&#8220;And let&#8217;s go back to the brass-knuckle-looking taser,&#8221; Gilligan said.        </p><p>
&#8220;Fly in the brass-knuckle taser!&#8221; a nearby crew member shouted into a walkie-talkie.        </p><p>
As the cameras were moved into place, Gilligan, who is 44 and speaks in a lyrical Southern drawl, reminisced fondly about some of the torments he has inflicted on Jesse Pinkman. One of the most gruesome was a plunge through the roof of a Port-a-Potty in a junkyard in Season 2.        </p><p>
&#8220;The original version was that he was going to get bit by a guard dog,&#8221; Gilligan said, leaning up against a rail and squinting against the New Mexico sun. &#8220;But the guard dog would have cost us $25,000, and we didn&#8217;t have the money. So we came up with the $5,000 outhouse gag. Which is quite a bit more memorable.&#8221;        </p><p>
Mordantly amusing ordeals are a specialty on &#8220;Breaking Bad,&#8221; which begins its fourth season on July 17. Credit the show&#8217;s forbiddingly grim premise: A 50-year-old high-school chemistry teacher named Walter White (played by Bryan Cranston) finds out he has terminal lung cancer and starts making crystal meth, hoping to leave behind a nest egg for his son and pregnant wife. Walter, it emerges, is a chemistry wizard, and after teaming up with Pinkman, a burnout student he once flunked, the pair drive a ramshackle R.V. into the desert and confect the purest, most coveted meth that local dealers have ever known. With the death penalty of his diagnosis looming, Walt wakes from the slumber of an unfulfilling life, evolving from feckless drudge to reluctant part-time criminal, then gradually to something worse.        </p><p>
In its first season, &#8220;Breaking Bad&#8221; seemed like the story of the nuttiest midlife crisis ever, told with elements that felt vaguely familiar. The structure &#8212; felonious dad copes with stress of work and family; complications ensue &#8212; owed an obvious debt to &#8220;The Sopranos,&#8221; and the collision of regular people and colorfully violent thugs nodded to Tarantino. The story and setting were an update of the spaghetti Western, minus the cowboys and set in the present.        </p><p>
But it was soon clear that &#8220;Breaking Bad&#8221; was something much more satisfying and complex: a revolutionary take on the serial drama. What sets the show apart from its small-screen peers is a subtle metaphysical layer all its own. As Walter inches toward damnation, Gilligan and his writers have posed some large questions about good and evil, questions with implications for every kind of malefactor you can imagine, from Ponzi schemers to terrorists. Questions like: Do we live in a world where terrible people go unpunished for their misdeeds? Or do the wicked ultimately suffer for their sins?        </p><p>
Gilligan has the nerve to provide his own hopeful answer. &#8220;Breaking Bad&#8221; takes place in a universe where nobody gets away with anything and karma is the great uncredited player in the cast. This moral dimension might explain why &#8220;Breaking Bad&#8221; has yet to achieve pop cultural breakthrough status, at least on the scale of other cable hits set in decidedly amoral universes, like &#8220;True Blood&#8221; or &#8220;Mad Men,&#8221; AMC&#8217;s far-more-buzzed-about series that takes place in an ad agency in the &#8217;60s. The total audience for &#8220;Breaking Bad&#8221; is only slightly smaller than that of &#8220;Mad Men&#8221; &#8212; 19.5 million versus 22.4 million cumulative viewers in their respective third seasons &#8212; but the top three markets for &#8220;Breaking Bad&#8221; are Albuquerque/Santa Fe, Kansas City and Memphis; neither New York nor Los Angeles are in its top 10. The show, in other words, doesn&#8217;t play on the coasts. It gets chatter, just not among what has long been considered the chattering class.        </p><nyt_author_id><div class="authorIdentification">

Which might make Gilligan TV&#8217;s first true red-state auteur. His characters lead middle-American lives in a middle-American place, and they are beset with middle-American problems. They speak like middle Americans too, and they inhabit a realm of moral ambiguities that&#8217;s overseen by a man with both a wicked sense of humor and a highly refined sense of right and wrong.        </p>

&#8220;If there&#8217;s a larger lesson to &#8216;Breaking Bad,&#8217; it&#8217;s that actions have consequences,&#8221; Gilligan said during lunch one day in his trailer. &#8220;If religion is a reaction of man, and nothing more, it seems to me that it represents a human desire for wrongdoers to be punished. I hate the idea of Idi Amin living in Saudi Arabia for the last 25 years of his life. That galls me to no end.&#8221;        </p><p>
He paused for a moment and speared a few tater tots in a white plastic-foam tray perched on his lap.        </p><p>
&#8220;I feel some sort of need for biblical atonement, or justice, or something,&#8221; he said between chews. &#8220;I like to believe there is some comeuppance, that karma kicks in at some point, even if it takes years or decades to happen,&#8221; he went on. &#8220;My girlfriend says this great thing that&#8217;s become my philosophy as well. &#8216;I want to believe there&#8217;s a heaven. But I can&#8217;t not believe there&#8217;s a hell.&#8217; &#8221;        </p><p>
&#8216;Breaking Bad&#8221; was born out of a conversation in 2004 between Gilligan and a friend named Thomas Schnauz, who is now a writer on the show. Schnauz had just read a story about a man cooking meth in an apartment complex, which had sickened kids in apartments above. Saddam Hussein&#8217;s putative mobile chemical-weapons labs came up in the conversation, too.        </p><p>
&#8220;Neither of us were working,&#8221; Schnauz says, &#8220;and we were like two 70-year-old men who like to complain about the world. And somehow we spun off into the idea of driving around in a mobile lab, cooking meth. It was a joke and not something I would have ever thought about again. But a couple days later Vince called back and said: &#8216;Remember we were talking about that mobile lab and meth? Do you mind if I run with that?&#8217; &#8221;        </p><p>
A show about a very smart middle-aged guy who hadn&#8217;t quite achieved his dreams had a faintly autobiographical whiff for Gilligan at the time. He grew up in Farmville, Va., a town of roughly 6,000 people, not far from Appomattox, the site of the South&#8217;s surrender in the Civil War. His father was an insurance claims adjuster, and his mother was a grade-school teacher who had a brief career as a wing walker. &#8220;Vince was an acolyte in the Catholic Church,&#8221; Gail Gilligan says, though she notes that he also played Dungeons and Dragons. &#8220;There was certainly a lot of evil in that game, but it never seemed to affect him adversely.&#8221;        </p><p>
Gilligan earned a partial scholarship to attend New York University&#8217;s film program, where his instructors included Jesse Kornbluth, who remembers a polite kid who was so good at drawing bent, violent characters that Kornbluth initially pegged him as the &#8220;go postal&#8221; type. &#8220;In the end, he turned us all into his audience,&#8221; Kornbluth said to me. &#8220;We were all just mesmerized. Attendance was unnaturally high on days when he was reading his scenes.&#8221;        </p><p>
After graduating, Gilligan won a screenplay contest in 1989, and one of the judges, a producer named Mark Johnson (now an executive producer on &#8220;Breaking Bad&#8221;), helped him find an agent and sell scripts to Hollywood. Two of them, &#8220;Home Fries,&#8221; starring Drew Barrymore, and &#8220;Wilder Napalm,&#8221; starring Debra Winger and Dennis Quaid, were turned into films. It was a promising start. Gilligan bought a house outside Richmond, assuming that he would keep lobbing movie scripts to Los Angeles, which would keep lobbing money back. That did not happen. By 1994, the money dried up and he lost his writer&#8217;s guild health insurance. That year, his agent got Gilligan a meeting with Chris Carter, the creator of &#8220;The X-Files.&#8221;        </p><nyt_author_id><div class="authorIdentification">

&#8220;I pitched them an idea about a guy whose shadow comes to life and sucks people in like a black hole and kills them,&#8221; he recalls. &#8220;They bought that as a freelance episode, and then I moved to California.&#8221; He spent seven years as a writer and producer on &#8220;The X-Files,&#8221; his first full-time TV job. The gig died with the show in 2002, and what followed was another succession of false starts and disappointments. There was &#8220;Lone Gunman,&#8221; a show for Fox, which expired after one year, and one for CBS called &#8220;Battle Creek,&#8221; which failed to ignite.        </p>

&#8220;I&#8217;ve had two fallow periods in my life,&#8221; Gilligan said. The first one was after his two movies were made. &#8220;The second was the five years after &#8216;X-Files.&#8217; Money wasn&#8217;t as big an issue as it was the first time, but as a writer you always want to be working on something that has a hope in hell of being made.&#8221;        </p><p>
In its basic outline, &#8220;Breaking Bad&#8221; &#8212; the title is a Southern phrase for going wild &#8212; also seemed destined for rejection. Its concept sounded a lot like that of &#8220;Weeds,&#8221; Showtime&#8217;s suburban pot-dealer series. Plus, its lead character is given a diagnosis of cancer within the first 20 minutes, and the action centers on one of the most destructive (and unglamorous) drugs known to man. Not to mention that the show ditches Rule No. 1 of series TV: the personality of the main character must stay the same.        </p><p>
&#8220;Television is really good at protecting the franchise,&#8221; Gilligan said. &#8220;It&#8217;s good at keeping the Korean War going for 11 seasons, like &#8216;M*A*S*H.&#8217; It&#8217;s good at keeping Marshal Dillon policing his little town for 20 years. By their very nature TV shows are open-ended. So I thought, Wouldn&#8217;t it be interesting to have a show that takes the protagonist and transforms him into the antagonist?&#8221;        </p><p>
That was the pitch to AMC executives in 2007. The network was searching for a second original series, to go along with &#8220;Mad Men,&#8221; which made its debut that year. The goal was to find something set in the present, so that AMC wasn&#8217;t pigeonholed as the home of period television. And management wanted a conceit that would skew male and complement the network&#8217;s library of antihero action movies, the kind that star Clint Eastwood and Charles Bronson. Sitting in his Manhattan office, Charlie Collier, the president of AMC, recalls his introduction to Gilligan&#8217;s work: &#8220;Our development team put the pilot script on my desk and said, &#8216;Just read this.&#8217; &#8221;        </p><p>
At the time that Gilligan conceived &#8220;Breaking Bad,&#8221; his past success, plus all the hackwork offers that could have kept him busy for years, fortified his sense that only a show built to his iconoclastic sensibility was worth doing. He wanted a show devoid of snappy banter (of the kind that Aaron Sorkin writes), and one that doesn&#8217;t flatter you for getting its winking references (as Matthew Weiner does in &#8220;Mad Men,&#8221; with his chain-smoking doctors and kids playing with dry-cleaning bags). And he wanted a leading man who would not only change over the course of the series but also suffer crushing reversals with lasting impact.        </p><p>
That is something new. The depravities of leading men in TV dramas traditionally don&#8217;t leave permanent scars. Don Draper of &#8220;Mad Men&#8221; is still pretty much the tippling rake he has been from the start, despite a flirtation or two with confession and reform. Tony Soprano tried, through therapy, to improve as a human being, but he didn&#8217;t get very far. Dr. House of &#8220;House&#8221; will always be a brilliant cuss. Walter White progresses from unassuming savant to opportunistic gangster &#8212; and as he does so, the show dares you to excuse him, or find a moral line that you deem a point of no return.        </p><nyt_author_id><div class="authorIdentification">

In 2007, if you needed an actor to dramatize so profound a transformation, Bryan Cranston would have seemed an unlikely choice. Before &#8220;Breaking Bad,&#8221; he was known as the dad in &#8220;Malcolm in the Middle,&#8221; a broadly comic role. When Gilligan told AMC executives that he wanted Cranston to play Walter, they initially were baffled. Then Gilligan explained that years earlier, he cast Cranston in an episode of &#8220;The X-Files.&#8221; &#8220;We had this villain, and we needed the audience to feel bad for him when he died,&#8221; Gilligan said. &#8220;Bryan alone was the only actor who could do that, who could pull off that trick. And it is a trick. I have no idea how he does it.&#8221;        </p> 
</nyt_text></div>
            
<div class="articleBody">
 <p>
Meeting Bryan Cranston only deepens the mystery. He is Walter&#8217;s opposite. The character is coiled and burdened, while Cranston in person is buoyant. Walter&#8217;s default facial expression is a rictus of angst, while Cranston&#8217;s is a mischievous smile. Cranston looks at least five years younger than the character, and his co-stars say, he often behaves like a 10-year-old. Aaron Paul described Cranston as &#8220;a kid trapped in a man&#8217;s body.&#8221; Anna Gunn, who plays Skyler, Walter&#8217;s wife, says that she has never seen an adult more amused by stuffing fruit down his pants. But Cranston&#8217;s performance as Walter White has made history, winning three Emmys in a row for outstanding lead in a drama series, the first actor to do so since Bill Cosby in &#8220;I Spy&#8221; in the mid-&#8217;60s.        </p><p>
&#8220;Physically, to create Walter White, I use my dad,&#8221; he said one night over dinner. &#8220;My dad is 87 years old. I&#8217;m not going to dodder, but Walter is always a little hunched over, never erect. The message to the audience is that the weight of the world is on this man&#8217;s shoulders.&#8221;        </p><p>
Cranston is from the total-commitment school of acting, and he once famously did a scene in &#8220;Malcolm in the Middle&#8221; while covered head to toe with bees. When Gilligan declined to fill in large holes in Walter&#8217;s back story, Cranston sat down and wrote out one of his own. On a handful of occasions, he has flagged lines in the script that felt false to him. Cranston reads each episode about a week in advance so that these bumps can be smoothed over before it&#8217;s time to start shooting. When he can&#8217;t resolve the issue with the writer on the set that week, a call is placed to Gilligan, who is usually in the writer&#8217;s room in Burbank. &#8220;It&#8217;s up to them, but I won&#8217;t bend unless I&#8217;m convinced it&#8217;s the right thing to do,&#8221; Cranston says. &#8220;Convince me and I&#8217;ll do it. I have a theory &#8212; our job isn&#8217;t to lie to the audience, our job is to find the truth in the character. If we lie, we&#8217;re giving the audience a little pinch of poison. They won&#8217;t even know they ingested it. But if you lie again and again and again, all of a sudden, your audience is going, &#8216;This isn&#8217;t working for me.&#8217; They just feel sick, and they turn you off.&#8221;        </p><p>
Cranston has found many nuanced ways to enact Walt&#8217;s many miseries, the most wrenching of which was the loss of his wife&#8217;s love. There is a long history in art of foisting suffering on characters who sin, but it seems to have fallen out of favor. As awful as Tony Soprano was, it&#8217;s left purposefully unclear at the end of &#8220;The Sopranos&#8221; whether he paid the ultimate price. Or consider the &#8220;simple chaos&#8221; take on the universe as represented in movies by Woody Allen, a director whom Gilligan admires. &#8220;And Woody Allen may be right,&#8221; Gilligan says. &#8220;I&#8217;m pretty much agnostic at this point in my life. But I find <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/a/atheism/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier" title="More articles about atheism." class="meta-classifier">atheism</a> just as hard to get my head around as I find fundamental Christianity. Because if there is no such thing as cosmic justice, what is the point of being good? That&#8217;s the one thing that no one has ever explained to me. Why shouldn&#8217;t I go rob a bank, especially if I&#8217;m smart enough to get away with it? What&#8217;s stopping me?&#8221;        </p><p>
On a cloudless day in May, five members of the cast and a scrum of crew members were shooting in what is referred to as &#8220;the Schrader house,&#8221; the home of Walter&#8217;s in-laws, Hank and Marie Schrader. It&#8217;s rented from a local couple and sits in the shadows of the type of steep, reddish mountains that Wile E. Coyote tumbled off chasing the Road Runner. Gilligan was the ringmaster of this circus, standing on the balcony and sipping a jumbo-size and constantly refilled McDonald&#8217;s container of unsweetened iced tea, which he calls brain juice. He was wearing what turned out to be his first pair of designer jeans. They were acquired during a recent shopping spree urged upon him by his girlfriend of 20 years, Holly Rice. His go-to pants have been $12 Wal-Mart jeans, he said, which is what he wore the following day.        </p><p>
He watched as a crew member put a series of sunglasses on the face of a 20ish Latino man with a nonspeaking background role.        </p><p>
&#8220;I like that one,&#8221; he said when the first pair of dark wraparounds were put on the actor&#8217;s face.        </p><p>
On went the second. &#8220;Not as good as the first,&#8221; Gilligan said.        </p><p>
Then the third. &#8220;Not as good as the first,&#8221; Gilligan repeated.        </p><p>
A fourth. &#8220;Let&#8217;s go with the first.&#8221;        </p><p>
This, it turns out, is an abbreviated version of a process that Gilligan goes through with virtually every article of clothing, every choice of color, every prop and every extra who appears in &#8220;Breaking Bad.&#8221; &#8220;You see this shirt?&#8221; said Dean Norris, who plays Hank Schrader, as he sat on the veranda between takes. He spoke in a stage whisper, out of the side of his mouth, like an inmate describing a warden who has gone insane. &#8220;Vince had to see five versions of it before he chose it. <em>Five different shades of a gray T-shirt.</em> That&#8217;s unique,&#8221; he said, heading into the house. &#8220;That&#8217;s beyond.&#8221;        </p><nyt_author_id><div class="authorIdentification">

Perfectionists often don&#8217;t play well with others, but Gilligan seems eager to accommodate everyone with an idea. It&#8217;s a running joke in the cast, the disconnect between Gilligan the person and Gilligan the writer. The former is sweet-tempered and polite; the latter strapped a character&#8217;s severed head to a tortoise, which was then rigged with explosives and blown up as D.E.A. agents swarmed around it.        </p> 
</nyt_text></div>
            
<div class="articleBody">
 <p>
During a break in the shooting, I asked Gilligan if, now four seasons into his show, he could explain the gulf between his manners and his material.        </p><p>
&#8220;I&#8217;m not the happiest person,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But I respect this crew and these actors. I try to be as cheerful as possible. I fake it pretty well.&#8221;        </p><p>
Well, a lot of people can fake cheerful. But how does such a benign-seeming person come up with such malign tales? Gilligan thought for a moment, then quoted Flaubert. &#8220;I&#8217;m not going to get this exactly right, but it&#8217;s something like, &#8216;You should be neat and orderly in your life so you can be violent and original in your work,&#8217; and there&#8217;s something to that,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s fun to explore that darkness and that criminal behavior on the page, but I&#8217;m too timid to do it in real life.&#8221;        </p><p>
The pilot of the show opened, memorably, with just such a burst of darkness and violence: Walt driving that R.V. through a desert in a crazed dash, wearing nothing but tighty-whitey briefs and a gas mask. Two male bodies roll in a soup of liquid, broken beakers and cash in the cabin. Cut to three weeks earlier. Walt is a regular schlub, in an unremarkable house, on his way to a mundane job. Gilligan slyly signals his overarching theme when Walter stands before his class and tells his students, &#8220;Chemistry is . . . well, technically it&#8217;s the study of matter, but I prefer to see it as the study of <em>change</em>.&#8221;        </p><p>
When you give your lead character a terminal illness, usher him into the underworld and embroil him in ever bolder and more ambitious criminal plans, you create a man who is rushing toward the ultimate change &#8212; from being alive to being dead. Walter White is surely the most doomed character on television, meaning that, just as &#8220;Breaking Bad&#8221; is finally winning acclaim, the end of the series is in sight. Which is just fine with Gilligan. He can imagine a fifth season of &#8220;Breaking Bad,&#8221; but that&#8217;s it.        </p><p>
Driving to the set after lunch one day, he told me that Walter White had started off as a person he could imagine chatting with over a beer.        </p><p>
&#8220;Now he&#8217;s not quite at the point where I&#8217;d cross the street if I saw him coming,&#8221; he said, with a smile. &#8220;But I wouldn&#8217;t want to be stuck in an elevator with him too long.&#8221; Plotting Walt&#8217;s transgressions has proved wearying enough. &#8220;It&#8217;s hard to write a character that dark and morally ambiguous,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to miss the show when it&#8217;s over, but on some level, it&#8217;ll be a relief to not have Walt in my head anymore.&#8221;        </p><nyt_author_id><div class="authorIdentification">
